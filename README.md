This is a solar system simulator made with Python and Pygame. It shows the Sun and planets moving in their orbits based on real physics. The simulation calculates planet positions using Keplerâ€™s laws and updates daily.

Features:
Realistic orbits with different speeds and distances.
Pause and resume with the spacebar.
Zoom in and out using + and - keys.
Current date display at the top left.
The planets move at different speeds, just like in real life. The Sun stays in the center, and the planets orbit around it.
