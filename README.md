This is a solar system simulator made with Python and Pygame. It shows the Sun and planets moving in their orbits based on real physics. The simulation calculates planet positions using Keplerâ€™s laws and updates daily.

Features:
1. Realistic orbits with different speeds and distances.
2. Accurate relative planet positions.
3. Pause and resume with the spacebar.
5. Zoom in and out using + and - keys.
6. Current date display at the top left.
7. The planets move at different speeds, just like in real life. The Sun stays in the center, and the planets orbit around it.
